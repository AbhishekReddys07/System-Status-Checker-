Note: not all the logic and additional functions are integrated, basically it's a baseline code, please check the below content to get an idea/Overview.

Key Features:

1. System Status Check: Users can enter the name of the system as wish to manage and check its online/offline status with a single click.
2. Remote Restart Capability: In case a device is found to be offline, users are prompted to provide their username and password for remote access. They can then initiate a restart operation for the offline device.
3. Username and Password Protection: To ensure security, the application prompts users to enter their credentials before executing any remote operations.
4. Error Handling: The application handles errors gracefully, providing informative messages in case of system unavailability or any unexpected issues during the operation.
Efficient Device Mapping: Device information is stored in a requirements file, allowing for quick and easy retrieval of device details such as IP addresses and MAC addresses.
5. Feedback Mechanism: Users receive real-time feedback on the status of their actions, with clear indications of whether a device is online/offline and the success of the restart operation.

Requirements:
   The targeted system should have a power supply continues irrespective of/on. 
   GUI should be connected to DB or file where data of config is stored.
